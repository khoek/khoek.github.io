# Honours thesis

Here is my honours thesis, [Drinfeld centers for bimodule categories](res/2019.honours.thesis.pdf). It was supervised by Professor [Scott Morrison](https://tqft.net) at the Australian National University.

At the conclusion of my honours year I gave a [colloquium-style talk](https://youtu.be/fcfduKYPUvw) on some results from the second chapter.
